    <abstract>
      <t>OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
      protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
      on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
      obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and 
      REST-like manner.</t>

      <t>
	This specification defines how an OpenID Connect Relying Party
	can dynamically register with the End-User's OpenID Provider,
	providing information about itself to the OpenID Provider,
	and obtaining information needed to use it,
	including the OAuth 2.0 Client ID for this Relying Party.

      <t>
	In order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID Connect services for
	an End-User, the RP needs to register with the OpenID Provider
	to provide the OP information about itself and
	to obtain information needed to use it,
	including an OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
	This document describes how an RP
	can register with an OP, and how registration information
	for the RP can be retrieved.

	<t>This specification defines the following additional terms:</t>

	<t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="Client Registration Endpoint">
	    <vspace/>
	    OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource through which a Client

    <section anchor="ClientMetadata" title="Client Metadata">
      <t>Clients have metadata associated with their
      unique Client Identifier at the Authorization Server. These can range
      from human-facing display strings, such as a Client name, to items that
      impact the security of the protocol, such as the list of valid redirect
      URIs.</t>
      <t>The Client Metadata values are used in two ways:</t>
      <t>
	<list style="symbols">
	  <t>
	    as input values to registration requests, and

      </t>
      <t>
	These Client Metadata values are used by OpenID Connect:

	<list style="hanging">

	  <t hangText="redirect_uris">
	    <vspace/>
	    REQUIRED.
	    Array of Redirection URI values used by the Client.
	    One of these registered Redirection URI values MUST exactly match
	    the <spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx> parameter
	    value used in each Authorization Request,
	    with the matching performed as described in
	    Section 6.2.1 of <xref target="RFC3986"/> (Simple String Comparison).
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="response_types">

	    JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0
	    <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx> values that
	    the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using.
	    If omitted, the default is that the Client will use only the
	    <spanx style="verb">code</spanx> Response Type.
	  </t>

          <t hangText="grant_types">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    JSON array containing a list of the OAuth 2.0 Grant Types that
	    the Client is declaring that it will restrict itself to using.
	    The Grant Type values used by OpenID Connect are:

	    <list style="symbols">
	      <t><spanx style="verb">authorization_code</spanx>: The
	      Authorization Code Grant Type described in OAuth 2.0 Section 4.1.</t>

	  </t>

	  <t hangText="application_type">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    Kind of the application.
	    The default, if omitted, is 
	    <spanx style="verb">web</spanx>.  The defined values are
	    <spanx style="verb">native</spanx>
	    or <spanx style="verb">web</spanx>.
	    Web Clients using the OAuth Implicit Grant Type
	    MUST only register URLs using the <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> scheme as
	    <spanx style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx>;
	    they MUST NOT use <spanx style="verb">localhost</spanx> as the hostname.
	    Native Clients MUST only register <spanx style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx> using custom 
	    URI schemes or URLs using the <spanx style="verb">http:</spanx> scheme with
	    <spanx style="verb">localhost</spanx> as the hostname.
	    Authorization Servers MAY place additional constraints on Native Clients.
	    Authorization Servers MAY reject Redirection URI values
	    using the <spanx style="verb">http</spanx> scheme, other than the
	    <spanx style="verb">localhost</spanx> case for Native Clients.
	    The Authorization Server MUST verify that all the registered 
	    <spanx style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx> conform to these constraints.  
	    This prevents sharing a Client ID across different types of Clients.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="contacts">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    Array of e-mail addresses of people responsible for this Client.
	    This might be used by some providers to enable a Web user interface to modify the 
	    Client information.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="client_name">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    Name of the Client
	    to be presented to the End-User. If desired, representation of 
	    this Claim in different languages and scripts is represented
	    as described in <xref target="LanguagesAndScripts"/>.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="logo_uri">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    URL that references a logo for the Client application.
	    If present, the server SHOULD display this image to the End-User during approval.
	    The value of this field MUST point to a valid image file.
	    If desired, representation of 
	    this Claim in different languages and scripts is represented
	    as described in <xref target="LanguagesAndScripts"/>.
	  </t>

          <t hangText="client_uri">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    URL of the home page of the Client.
	    The value of this field MUST point to a valid Web page.
	    If present, the server SHOULD display this URL to the End-User in a
	    followable fashion.
	    If desired, representation of 
	    this Claim in different languages and scripts is represented
	    as described in <xref target="LanguagesAndScripts"/>.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="policy_uri">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    URL that the Relying 
	    Party Client provides to the End-User to read about the how the
	    profile data will be used.
	    The value of this field MUST point to a valid web page.
	    The OpenID Provider SHOULD display this
	    URL to the End-User if it is given.
	    If desired, representation of 
	    this Claim in different languages and scripts is represented
	    as described in <xref target="LanguagesAndScripts"/>.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="tos_uri">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    URL that the Relying 
	    Party Client provides to the End-User to read about
	    the Relying Party's terms of service.
	    The value of this field MUST point to a valid web page.
	    The OpenID Provider SHOULD display this
	    URL to the End-User if it is given.
	    If desired, representation of 
	    this Claim in different languages and scripts is represented
	    as described in <xref target="LanguagesAndScripts"/>.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="jwks_uri">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    URL for the Client's JSON Web Key Set <xref target="JWK"/> document.
	    If the Client signs requests to the Server,
	    it contains the signing key(s) the Server uses to validate signatures from the Client.
	    The JWK Set MAY also contain the Client's encryption keys(s),
	    which are used by the Server to encrypt responses to the Client.
	    When both signing and encryption keys are made available,
	    a <spanx style="verb">use</spanx> (Key Use) parameter
	    value is REQUIRED for all keys in the referenced JWK Set
	    to indicate each key's intended usage.
	    Although some algorithms allow the same key to be used for
	    both signatures and encryption, doing so is
	    NOT RECOMMENDED, as it is less secure.
	    The JWK <spanx style="verb">x5c</spanx> parameter MAY be used
	    to provide X.509 representations of keys provided.  When used, the bare key
	    values MUST still be present and MUST match those in the certificate.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="jwks">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    Client's JSON Web Key Set <xref target="JWK"/> document, passed by value.
	    The semantics of the <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> parameter are the same
	    as the <spanx style="verb">jwks_uri</spanx> parameter, other than that
	    the JWK Set is passed by value, rather than by reference.
	    This parameter is intended only to be used by Clients that, for some reason,
	    are unable to use the <spanx style="verb">jwks_uri</spanx> parameter,
	    for instance, by native applications that might not have a location
	    to host the contents of the JWK Set.
	    If a Client can use <spanx style="verb">jwks_uri</spanx>,
	    it MUST NOT use <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx>.
	    One significant downside of <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx> is that it
	    does not enable key rotation
	    (which <spanx style="verb">jwks_uri</spanx> does, as described in
	    Section 10 of <xref target="OpenID.Core">OpenID Connect Core 1.0</xref>).
	    The <spanx style="verb">jwks_uri</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">jwks</spanx>
	    parameters MUST NOT be used together.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="sector_identifier_uri">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    URL using the <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> scheme to be used in
	    calculating Pseudonymous Identifiers by the OP. The URL references a
	    file with a single JSON array of <spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx> values.
	    Please see <xref target="SectorIdentifierValidation" />.
	    Providers that use pairwise <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) values
	    SHOULD utilize the <spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx> value
	    provided in the Subject Identifier calculation for pairwise identifiers.
	  </t>

	  <t hangText="subject_type">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    <spanx style="verb">subject_type</spanx> requested for 
	    responses to this Client.
	    The <spanx style="verb">subject_types_supported</spanx> Discovery parameter
	    contains a list of the supported <spanx style="verb">subject_type</spanx>
	    values for this server. Valid types include
	    <spanx style="verb">pairwise</spanx> and
	    <spanx style="verb">public</spanx>.

	    The value <spanx style="verb">none</spanx>
	    MUST NOT be used as the ID Token <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> value
	    unless the Client uses only Response Types that return no ID Token from the
	    Authorization Endpoint
	    (such as when only using the Authorization Code Flow).
	    The default, if omitted, is <spanx style="verb">RS256</spanx>.
	    The public key for validating the signature is provided by retrieving the 
	    JWK Set referenced by the
	    <spanx style="verb">jwks_uri</spanx> element from

	    If this is specified, the response will be 
	    <xref target="JWT">JWT</xref> serialized, and signed using JWS.
	    The default, if omitted, is for the UserInfo Response to

      view and update its registered information. The Client MUST use its
      Registration Access Token in all calls to this endpoint as an
      OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token <xref target="RFC6750"/>.</t>

      <t>Operations on this endpoint are switched through the use of different
      HTTP methods <xref target="RFC2616"/>.
      The only method defined for use at this endpoint by this specification

      <section anchor="AccessURL"
               title="Forming the Client Configuration Endpoint URL">
        <t>
	  If a Client Configuration Endpoint and a Registration Access Token
	  are returned by the initial registration of the Client,
	  the Authorization Server MUST provide the Client with the fully
        qualified URL in the <spanx style="verb">registration_client_uri</spanx>
        element of the Client Registration Response, per <xref target="RegistrationResponse"/>.
	The Authorization Server MUST NOT expect the Client
        to construct or discover this URL on its own. The Client MUST use the
        URL as given by the server and MUST NOT construct this URL from
        component pieces.</t>

        <t>Depending on deployment characteristics, the Client Configuration
        Endpoint URL can take any number of forms. It is RECOMMENDED that this
        endpoint URL be formed through the use of a server-constructed URL
        string which combines the Client Registration Endpoint's URL and the
        issued Client ID for this Client, with the latter as either a path
        parameter or a query parameter. For example, a Client with the Client
        ID <spanx style="verb">s6BhdRkqt3</spanx> could be given a Client
        Configuration Endpoint URL of <spanx style="verb">https://server.example.com/register/s6BhdRkqt3</spanx>

        (query parameter). In both of these cases, the Client simply uses
        the URL as given.</t>

        <t>These common patterns can help the Server to more easily determine
        the Client to which the request pertains, which MUST be matched
        against the Client to which the Registration Access Token was issued.
        If desired, the Server MAY simply return the Client Registration
        Endpoint URL as the Client Configuration Endpoint URL and change
        behavior based on the authentication context provided by the

	in this specification as being "REQUIRED" or are described with a "MUST".

      <t>
	As of the time of this writing,
	this specification is compatible with the current version of
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-oauth-dyn-reg">OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration Protocol</xref>, draft -20.
	The Dynamic Client Registration work is still ongoing at the IETF
	and changes may or may not be made there

	Implementations wanting to support additional operations defined in

      </t>

      <section anchor="PreFinalIETFSpecs" title="Pre-Final IETF Specifications">

	<t>

	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t><xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT) draft -25</xref></t>

	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  While every effort will be made to prevent breaking
	  changes to these specifications, should they occur,
	  OpenID Connect implementations should continue to use the
	  specifically referenced draft versions above in preference
	  to the final versions, unless using a possible future
	  OpenID Connect profile or specification that
	  updates some or all of these references.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="StatelessRegistration" title="Implementation Notes on Stateless Dynamic Client Registration">
	<t>
	  In some deployments, it is advantageous to enable Clients to obtain
	  the information necessary to interact with the Authorization Server,
	  such as a Client Identifier,
	  without the requirement that state about the Client be stored at the
	  Authorization Server.
	  The interfaces defined by this specification can be used for
	  stateless dynamic client registration.
	</t>
	<t>
	  One means of doing this is to encode necessary registration information
	  about the Client into the <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx>
	  value returned by the initial registration of the Client.
	  This has the effect of having the Client store this information,
	  rather than the Authorization Server.
	  The particular encodings used by different Authorization Servers will differ.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When stateless dynamic client registration is used by the Authorization Server,
	  read operations are likely to not be possible,
	  because issuing a Registration Access Token might require
	  per-Client state at the Authorization Server.
	  In that case, no Client Configuration Endpoint or Registration Access Token
	  will be returned by the initial registration of the Client.
	</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Since requests to the Client Registration Endpoint result in the
      transmission of clear-text credentials (in the HTTP request and
      response),
      all communication with the Registration Endpoint MUST utilize TLS.
      See <xref target="TLSRequirements"/> for more information on using TLS.
      </t>

      <section anchor="Impersonation" title="Impersonation">

	<t>
	  A rogue RP might use the logo for the legitimate RP, which it
	  is trying to impersonate. An OP needs to take steps to
	  mitigate this phishing risk, since the logo could confuse
	  users into thinking they're logging in to the legitimate
	  RP. An OP could also warn if the domain/site of the logo
	  doesn't match the domain/site of registered Redirection URIs. An OP can also
	  make warnings against untrusted RPs in all cases, especially
	  if they're dynamically registered, have not been trusted by
	  any users at the OP before, and want to use the logo feature.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In a situation where the Authorization Server is supporting open Client 
	  registration, 
	  it needs to be extremely careful with any URL provided by the Client that will 
	  be displayed to the End-User (e.g. <spanx style="verb">logo_uri</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">policy_uri</spanx>). A rogue Client could 
	  specify a registration request with a reference to a drive-by download in the 
	  <spanx style="verb">policy_uri</spanx>. The Authorization Server SHOULD check to see if the
	  <spanx style="verb">logo_uri</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">policy_uri</spanx> have the 
	  same host as the hosts defined in the array of <spanx style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx>.

      <section anchor="NativeCodeLeakage" title="Native Code Leakage">

	<t>
	  Implementers should be aware that on iOS, information is
	  returned to native applications using custom URI schemes,
	  but multiple applications can register the same URI scheme.
	  In this case, it is nondeterministic which application
	  receives the information.
	  This can result in an Authorization Code being leaked to
	  the wrong application.
	  Several possible solutions to this have been proposed
	  and are being discussed in the IETF OAuth working group.
	  It is expected that a standard solution to this problem
	  will be developed there.
	  At that point, an extension to OpenID Connect may
	  be published describing how to apply that solution
	  to OpenID Connect.

      </section>

      <section anchor="TLSRequirements" title="TLS Requirements">
	<t>
	  Implementations MUST support TLS.
	  Which version(s) ought to be implemented will vary over
	  time, and depend on the widespread deployment and known
	  security vulnerabilities at the time of implementation.
	  At the time of this writing,
	  TLS version 1.2 <xref target='RFC5246' />
	  is the most recent version, but has very limited actual
	  deployment, and might not be readily available in
	  implementation toolkits.
	  TLS version 1.0 <xref target='RFC2246' />
	  is the most widely deployed version, and will give the
	  broadest interoperability.
	</t>
	<t>
	  To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
	  confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS
	  with a ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and
	  integrity protection.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check
	  MUST be performed, per <xref target="RFC6125">RFC 6125</xref>.
