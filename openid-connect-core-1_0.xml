      <t>
	OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
	<xref target="RFC6749"/>
	protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
	on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
	obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and 
	REST-like manner.
      </t>
      <t>
	The OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification defines
	the core OpenID Connect functionality:
	authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and
	the use of Claims to communicate information about the End-User.
	It also describes the security and privacy considerations for using OpenID Connect.
      </t>

      <t>
	As background,
	the <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework</xref>
	and <xref target="RFC6750">OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage</xref>
	specifications provide a general framework for third-party applications
	to obtain and use limited access to HTTP resources.  They define
	mechanisms to obtain and use Access Tokens to access resources but
	do not define standard methods to provide identity information.
	Notably, without profiling OAuth 2.0, it is incapable of
	providing information about the authentication of an End-User.
	Readers are expected to be familiar with these specifications.
      </t>
      <t>
	OpenID Connect implements authentication as an extension to the
	OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
	Use of this extension is requested by Clients by including
	the <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value
	in the Authorization Request.
	Information about the authentication performed is returned
	in a <xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref>
	called an ID Token (see <xref target="IDToken"/>).
	OAuth 2.0 Authentication Servers implementing OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as OpenID Providers (OPs).
	OAuth 2.0 Clients using OpenID Connect
	are also referred to as Relying Parties (RPs).
      </t>
      <t>
	This specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	configuration information about the OpenID Provider, including its
	Authorization Endpoint and Token Endpoint locations.
	This information is normally obtained via Discovery,
	as described in <xref target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref>,
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t>
	Likewise, this specification assumes that the Relying Party has already obtained
	sufficient credentials and provided information needed to use the OpenID Provider.
	This is normally done via Dynamic Registration,
	as described in
	<xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>,
	or may be obtained via other mechanisms.
      </t>

	For this reason, the Client is called Relying Party (RP) in this case.

		  If the ID Token is received via direct

	    While this specification defines only a small set of Claims as

	    When using such Claims, it is RECOMMENDED that

	    <xref target="JWT">JSON Web Token (JWT)</xref> specification.

      <section anchor="ClaimsLanguagesAndScripts" title="Claims Languages and Scripts">
	<t>
	  Human-readable Claim Values and Claim Values that reference human-readable values
	  MAY be represented in multiple languages and scripts.
	  To specify the languages and scripts, <xref
	  target="RFC5646">BCP47</xref> language tags are added to member names,
	  delimited by a <spanx style="verb">#</spanx> character.  For example,
	  <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Kana-JP</spanx> expresses the
	  Family Name in Katakana in Japanese, which is commonly used to index
	  and represent the phonetics of the Kanji representation of the same
	  represented as <spanx style="verb">family_name#ja-Hani-JP</spanx>.
	  As another example, both <spanx style="verb">website</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">website#de</spanx> Claim Values might be returned,
	  referencing a Web site in an unspecified language and a Web site
	  in German.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Since Claim Names are case sensitive, it is strongly RECOMMENDED
	  that language tag values used in Claim Names be spelled using the
	  character case with which they are registered in the
	  <xref target="IANA.Language">IANA Language Subtag Registry</xref>.
	  In particular, normally language names are spelled with lowercase characters,
	  region names are spelled with uppercase characters, and
	  scripts are spelled with mixed case characters.
	  However, since BCP47 language tag values are case insensitive,
	  implementations SHOULD interpret the language tag values supplied
	  in a case insensitive manner.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Per the recommendations in BCP47, language tag values for Claims
	  SHOULD only be as specific as necessary.
	  For instance, using <spanx style="verb">fr</spanx> might be sufficient
	  in many contexts, rather than <spanx style="verb">fr-CA</spanx> or
	  <spanx style="verb">fr-FR</spanx>.
	  Where possible, OPs SHOULD try to match requested Claim locales with
	  Claims it has.  For instance, if the Client asks for a Claim with
	  a <spanx style="verb">de</spanx> (German) language tag and the OP
	  has a value tagged with <spanx style="verb">de-CH</spanx> (Swiss German)
	  and no generic German value, it would be appropriate for the OP
	  to return the Swiss German value to the Client.
	  (This intentionally moves as much of the complexity of language tag
	  matching to the OP as possible, to simplify Clients.)
	</t>
	<t>
	  OpenID Connect defines the following Authorization Request parameter
	  to enable specify the preferred languages and scripts to be used
	  for the returned Claims:

	  <list style="hanging">

	    <t hangText="claims_locales">
	      <vspace/>
	      OPTIONAL.
	      End-User's preferred languages and scripts for Claims being returned, 
	      represented as a space-separated list of
	      <xref target="RFC5646">BCP47</xref> language tag values,
	      ordered by preference.
	      An error SHOULD NOT result if some or all of the requested locales
	      are not supported by the OpenID Provider.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  When the OP determines, either through the
	  <spanx style="verb">claims_locales</spanx> parameter,
	  or by other means, that the End-User and Client are
	  requesting Claims in only one set of languages and scripts,
	  it is RECOMMENDED that OPs return Claims without language tags
	  when they employ this language and script.
	  It is also RECOMMENDED that Clients be written in a manner
	  that they can handle and utilize Claims using language tags.

	  OpenID Connect Clients use <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> values,
	  as defined in Section 3.3 of <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref>,
	  to specify what
	  access privileges are being requested for Access Tokens. The scopes associated
	  with Access Tokens determine what resources will be available when they are 
	  used to access OAuth 2.0 protected endpoints.
	  Protected Resource endpoints MAY perform different actions and
	  return different information based on the scope values and other parameters
	  used when requesting the presented Access Token.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For OpenID Connect, scopes
	  can be used to request that specific sets of information
	  be made available as Claim Values.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Claims requested by the following scopes are treated by Authorization Servers
	  as Voluntary Claims.

	<t>
	  <list style="hanging">

	    <t hangText="profile">

	  when a <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx> value is used
	  that results in an Access Token being issued.
	  However, when no Access Token is issued

      <section anchor="ClaimsParameter" title='Requesting Claims using the "claims" Request Parameter'>

	<t>
	  OpenID Connect defines the following Authorization Request parameter
	  to enable requesting individual Claims
	  and specifying parameters that apply to the requested Claims:

	  <list style="hanging">

	    <t hangText="claims">
	      <vspace/>
	      OPTIONAL.
	      This parameter is used to request that specific Claims be returned.
	      The value is a JSON object listing the requested Claims.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> Authentication Request
	  parameter requests that specific Claims
	  be returned from the UserInfo Endpoint and/or in the ID Token.
	  It is represented as a JSON object containing lists of Claims being requested
	  from these locations.
	  Properties of the Claims being requested MAY also be specified.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Support for the <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> parameter is OPTIONAL.
	  Should an OP not support this parameter and an RP uses it,
	  the OP SHOULD return a set of Claims to the RP that it believes would
	  be useful to the RP and the End-User using whatever heuristics it
	  believes are appropriate.
	  The <spanx style="verb">claims_parameter_supported</spanx>
	  Discovery result indicates whether the OP supports this parameter.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> parameter value is represented
	  in an OAuth 2.0 request as UTF-8 encoded JSON
	  (which ends up being form-urlencoded when passed as an OAuth parameter).
	  When used in a Request Object value, per <xref target="RequestObject"/>,
	  the JSON is used as the value of the
	  <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> member.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The top-level members of the Claims request JSON object are:

	  <list style="hanging">
	    <t hangText="userinfo">

	      If present, the listed Claims are being requested to be added to
	      any Claims that are being requested using
	      <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> values.
	      If not present, the Claims being requested from the UserInfo Endpoint
	      are only those requested using  <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> values.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      When the <spanx style="verb">userinfo</spanx> member is used,
	      the request MUST also use a <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx>
	      value that results in an Access Token being issued to the Client
	      for use at the UserInfo Endpoint.
	    </t>

	    <t hangText="id_token">

	<section anchor="IndividualClaimsRequests" title="Individual Claims Requests">
	  <t>
	    The <spanx style="verb">userinfo</spanx> and
	    <spanx style="verb">id_token</spanx> members of the
	    <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> request both are JSON objects

	    The member values MUST be one of the following:

	    <list style="hanging">
	      <t hangText="null">
		<vspace/>
		Indicates that this Claim is being requested in the default manner.
		In particular, this is a Voluntary Claim.
		For instance, the Claim request:

		<figure>
		  <artwork><![CDATA[
  "given_name": null
]]></artwork>
		</figure>

		requests the <spanx style="verb">given_name</spanx> Claim
		in the default manner.
	      </t>
	      <t hangText="JSON Object">
		<vspace/>
		Used to provide additional information about the Claim being 
		requested. This specification defines the following members: 

		<list style="hanging">
		  <t hangText="essential">
		    <vspace/>
		    OPTIONAL.
		    Indicates whether the Claim being requested is an Essential Claim.
		    If the value is <spanx style="verb">true</spanx>, 
		    this indicates that the Claim is an Essential Claim.
		    For instance, the Claim request:

		    <figure>
		      <artwork><![CDATA[
  "auth_time": {"essential": true}
]]></artwork>
		    </figure>

		    can be used to specify that it is Essential to return an
		    <spanx style="verb">auth_time</spanx> Claim Value.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    If the value is <spanx style="verb">false</spanx>,
		    it indicates that it is a Voluntary Claim.
		    The default is <spanx style="verb">false</spanx>.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    By requesting Claims as Essential Claims,
		    the RP indicates to the End-User
		    that releasing these Claims will ensure a smooth authorization
		    for the specific task requested by the End-User.
		    Note that even if the Claims are not available because
		    the End-User did not authorize their release or they are not present,
		    the Authorization Server MUST NOT generate an error when
		    Claims are not returned, whether they are Essential or Voluntary,
		    unless otherwise specified in the description of the specific claim.
		  </t>

		  <t hangText="value">
		    <vspace/>
		    OPTIONAL.
		    Requests that the Claim be returned with a particular value.
		    For instance the Claim request:

		    <figure>
		      <artwork><![CDATA[
  "sub": {"value": "248289761001"}
]]></artwork>
		    </figure>

		  </t>
		  <t>
		    The value of the <spanx style="verb">value</spanx> member

		    qualifier is to be used when requesting that Claim.
		  </t>
		  <t hangText="values">
		    <vspace/>
		    OPTIONAL.
		    Requests that the Claim be returned with one of a set of values,
		    with the values appearing in order of preference.
		    For instance the Claim request:

		    specifies that it is Essential that the <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx>
		    Claim be returned with either the value
		    <spanx style="verb">urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver</spanx> or
		    <spanx style="verb">urn:mace:incommon:iap:bronze</spanx>.
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    The values in the <spanx style="verb">values</spanx> member array
		    MUST be valid values for the Claim being requested.
		    Definitions of individual Claims can include requirements on
		    how and whether the <spanx style="verb">values</spanx>
		    qualifier is to be used when requesting that Claim.

	    Note that when the <spanx style="verb">claims</spanx> request parameter
	    is supported, the scope values that request Claims, as defined in
	    <xref target="ScopeClaims"/>, are effectively shorthand methods for
	    requesting sets of individual Claims.
	    For example, using the scope value <spanx style="verb">openid email</spanx>
	    and a <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx> that returns an Access Token
	    is equivalent to using the scope value <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx>
	    and the following request for individual Claims.

	      the Authorization Server MUST return an <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx>
	      Claim Value that matches one of the requested values.
	      The Authorization Server MAY ask the End-User to re-authenticate
	      with additional factors
	      to meet this requirement. If this is an Essential Claim and the
	      requirement cannot be met, then the Authorization Server MUST
	      treat that outcome as a failed authentication attempt.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Note that the RP MAY request the <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx>
	      Claim as a Voluntary Claim
	      by using the <spanx style="verb">acr_values</spanx> request parameter
	      or by not including "essential": true in an individual
	      <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx> Claim request.
	      If the Claim is not Essential and a requested value
	      cannot be provided, the Authorization Server SHOULD return
	      the session's current <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx> as
	      the value of the <spanx style="verb">acr</spanx> Claim.
	      If the Claim is not Essential, the Authorization Server is not required to
	      provide this Claim in its response.

	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) and
	  <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer) Claims, used together,
	  are the only Claims that an RP
	  can rely upon as a stable identifier for the End-User,
	  since the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>
	  Claim MUST be locally unique and never reassigned within the Issuer
	  for a particular End-User, as described in <xref target="IDToken"></xref>.
	  Therefore, the only guaranteed unique identifier for a given End-User is the
	  combination of the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> Claim
	  and the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> Claim.
	</t>
	<t>
	  All other Claims carry no such guarantees across different issuers in terms of
	  stability over time or uniqueness across users, and Issuers are permitted to
	  apply local restrictions and policies. For instance, an Issuer MAY re-use an
	  <spanx style="verb">email</spanx> Claim Value across different
	  End-Users at different points in time, and the claimed 
	  <spanx style="verb">email</spanx> address for a given End-User MAY change 
	  over time.
	  Therefore, other Claims such as <spanx style="verb">email</spanx>,
	  <spanx style="verb">phone_number</spanx>, and
	  <spanx style="verb">preferred_username</spanx>
	  and MUST NOT be used as unique identifiers for the End-User.

    <section anchor="JWTRequests" title="Passing Request Parameters as JWTs">

      <t>
	OpenID Connect defines the following Authorization Request parameters
	to enable Authentication Requests to be signed and optionally encrypted:

	<list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="request">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    This parameter enables
	    OpenID Connect requests to be passed in a single,
	    self-contained parameter and to be optionally signed and/or encrypted.
	    The parameter value is a Request Object value,
	    as specified in <xref target="RequestObject"/>.
	    It represents the request as a JWT whose Claims
	    are the request parameters.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="request_uri">
	    <vspace/>
	    OPTIONAL.
	    This parameter enables
	    OpenID Connect requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value.
	    The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value is a URL
	    using the <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> scheme
	    referencing a resource containing a Request Object value,
	    which is a JWT containing the request parameters.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	Requests using these parameters are represented as JWTs, which are respectively
	passed by value or by reference.
	The ability to pass requests by reference is particularly useful for large requests.
	If one of these parameters is used,
	the other MUST NOT be used in the same request.
      </t>

      <section title="Passing a Request Object by Value" anchor="RequestObject">

	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> Authorization Request parameter
	  enables OpenID Connect requests to be passed in a single,
	  self-contained parameter and to be optionally signed and/or encrypted.
	  It represents the request as a JWT whose Claims are the request parameters
	  specified in <xref target="AuthorizationEndpoint"/>.
	  This JWT is called a Request Object.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Support for the <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> parameter is OPTIONAL.
	  The <spanx style="verb">request_parameter_supported</spanx>
	  Discovery result indicates whether the OP supports this parameter.
	  Should an OP not support this parameter and an RP uses it,
	  the OP MUST return the <spanx style="verb">request_not_supported</spanx>
	  error.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When the <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> parameter is used,
	  the OpenID Connect request parameter values contained in the JWT
	  supersede those passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax.
	  However, parameters MAY also be passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax
	  even when a Request Object is used;
	  this would typically be done to enable a cached,
	  pre-signed (and possibly pre-encrypted) Request Object value
	  to be used containing the fixed request parameters, while parameters that
	  can vary with each request, such as <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx>, are passed as OAuth 2.0 parameters.
	</t>
	<t>
	  So that the request is a valid OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request,
	  values for the <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx> parameters MUST be included
	  using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax, since they are REQUIRED by OAuth 2.0.
	  The values for these parameters MUST match those in the Request Object,
	  if present.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Even if a <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> parameter
	  is present in the Request Object value,
	  a <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> parameter MUST always be passed using
	  the OAuth 2.0 request syntax containing the
	  <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value to indicate to the
	  underlying OAuth 2.0 logic that this is an OpenID Connect request.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The Request Object MAY be signed or unsigned (plaintext).
	  When it is plaintext, this is indicated by use of the
	  <spanx style="verb">none</spanx> algorithm <xref target="JWA" />
	  in the JOSE Header.  If signed, the Request Object
	  SHOULD contain the Claims
	  <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer)
	  and <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> (audience) as members.
	  The <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> value SHOULD be the Client ID of the RP,
	  unless it was signed by a different party than the RP.
	  The <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> value SHOULD be or include
	  the OP's Issuer Identifier URL.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The Request Object MAY also be encrypted using <xref target="JWE">JWE</xref>
	  and MAY be encrypted without also being signed.
	  If both signing and encryption are performed, it MUST be signed then encrypted,
	  with the result being a Nested JWT, as defined in <xref target="JWT"/>.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> parameters
	  MUST NOT be included in Request Objects.

      <section anchor="RequestUriParameter" title="Passing a Request Object by Reference">
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> Authorization Request parameter enables
	  OpenID Connect requests to be passed by reference, rather than by value.
	  This parameter is used identically to the
	  <spanx style="verb">request</spanx> parameter, other than that
	  the Request Object value is retrieved from the resource at the specified URL,
	  rather than passed by value.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">request_uri_parameter_supported</spanx>
	  Discovery result indicates whether the OP supports this parameter.
	  Should an OP not support this parameter and an RP uses it,
	  the OP MUST return the <spanx style="verb">request_uri_not_supported</spanx>
	  error.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When the <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> parameter is used,
	  the OpenID Connect request parameter values contained in the referenced JWT
	  supersede those passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax.
	  However, parameters MAY also be passed using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax
	  even when a <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> is used;
	  this would typically be done to enable a cached,
	  pre-signed (and possibly pre-encrypted) Request Object value
	  to be used containing the fixed request parameters, while parameters that
	  can vary with each request, such as <spanx style="verb">state</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx>, are passed as OAuth 2.0 parameters.
	</t>
	<t>
	  So that the request is a valid OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request,
	  values for the <spanx style="verb">response_type</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">client_id</spanx> parameters MUST be included
	  using the OAuth 2.0 request syntax, since they are REQUIRED by OAuth 2.0.
	  The values for these parameters MUST match those in the Request Object,
	  if present.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Even if a <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> parameter
	  is present in the referenced Request Object,
	  a <spanx style="verb">scope</spanx> parameter MUST always be passed using
	  the OAuth 2.0 request syntax containing the
	  <spanx style="verb">openid</spanx> scope value to indicate to the
	  underlying OAuth 2.0 logic that this is an OpenID Connect request.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Servers MAY cache the contents of the resources referenced by Request URIs.
	  If the contents of the referenced resource could ever change,
	  the URI SHOULD include the base64url encoded SHA-256 hash of the
	  referenced resource contents as the fragment component of the URI.
	  If the fragment value used for a URI changes, that signals the server
	  that any cached value for that URI with the old fragment value
	  is no longer valid.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that Clients MAY pre-register
	  <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> values using the
	  <spanx style="verb">request_uris</spanx> parameter defined in
	  Section 2.1 of the
	  <xref target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>
	  specification.
	  OPs can require that <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> values used
	  be pre-registered with the <spanx style="verb">require_request_uri_registration</spanx>
	  discovery parameter.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The entire Request URI MUST NOT exceed 512 ASCII characters.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The contents of the resource referenced by the URL MUST be a Request Object.
	  The scheme used in the 
	  <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value MUST be <spanx style="verb">https</spanx>, 
	  unless the target Request Object is signed in a way that is verifiable by the 
	  Authorization Server.
	  The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value MUST be reachable by the
	  Authorization Server, and SHOULD be reachable by the Client.
	</t>

	<section anchor="RequestUriRationale" title="&quot;request_uri&quot; Rationale">
	  <t>
	    There are several reasons that one might choose to use the

	  </t>
	  <t>
	    <list style="numbers">
	      <t>
		The set of request parameters can become large, and can exceed browser
		URI size limitations.  Passing the request parameters by reference
		can solve this problem.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Passing a <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value, rather than
		a complete request by value, can reduce request latency.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Most requests for Claims from an RP are constant.
		The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> is a way of creating
		and sometimes also signing and encrypting a constant set of
		request parameters in advance.
		(The <spanx style="verb">request_uri</spanx> value becomes an "artifact"
		representing a particular fixed set of request parameters.)
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Pre-registering a fixed set of request parameters at Registration time
		enables OPs to cache and pre-validate the request parameters at
		Registration time, meaning they need not be retrieved at request time.
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Pre-registering a fixed set of request parameters at
		Registration time enables OPs to vet the contents of
		the request from consumer protection and other points
		of views, either itself or by utilizing a third party.

	      REQUIRED.
	      Public key used to check the signature of an ID Token
	      issued by a Self-Issued OpenID Provider,
	      as specified in <xref target="SelfIssued"/>.
	      The key is a bare key in JWK <xref target="JWK"/> format
	      (not an X.509 certificate value).
	      The <spanx style="verb">sub_jwk</spanx> value is a JSON object.
	      Use of the <spanx style="verb">sub_jwk</spanx> Claim
	      is NOT RECOMMENDED when the OP is not Self-Issued.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>
	  The Self-Issued OpenID Provider response is the same as the normal Implicit Flow 
	  response with the following refinements.  Since it is an Implicit Flow
	  response, the response parameters will be returned in the URL fragment component,
	  unless a different Response Mode was specified.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <list style="numbers">

	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) Claim
	      value is the base64url encoded representation of
	      the thumbprint of
	      the key in the <spanx style="verb">sub_jwk</spanx> Claim.
	      This thumbprint value is computed as
	      the SHA-256 hash of
	      the octets of the UTF-8 representation of
	      a JWK constructed containing only the REQUIRED members to represent the key,
	      with the member names sorted into lexicographic order,
	      and with no white space or line breaks.
	      For instance,
	      when the <spanx style="verb">kty</spanx> value is

	      <spanx style="verb">x</spanx>, and
	      <spanx style="verb">y</spanx>
	      are present in that order.
	      Note that this thumbprint calculation is the same as that defined in
	      the JWK Thumbprint <xref target="JWK.Thumbprint"/> specification.
	    </t>

	      No Access Token is returned for accessing a UserInfo Endpoint,

    <section anchor="SubjectIDTypes" title="Subject Identifier Types">
      <t>
	A Subject Identifier is a locally unique and never
	reassigned identifier within the Issuer for the End-User, 
	which is intended to be consumed by the Client.
	Two Subject Identifier types are defined by this specification:

	<list style="hanging">
	  <t hangText="public">
	    <vspace/>
	    This provides the same <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) value to all Clients.
	    It is the default if the provider has no <spanx style="verb">subject_types_supported</spanx>
	    element in its discovery document.
	  </t>
	  <t hangText="pairwise">
	    <vspace/>
	    This provides a different <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx>
	    value to each Client, so as not to enable Clients to correlate
	    the End-User's activities without permission.
	  </t>
	</list>
      </t>
      <t>
	The OpenID Provider's Discovery document SHOULD list
	its supported Subject Identifier types in the
	<spanx style="verb">subject_types_supported</spanx> element.
	If there is more than one type listed in the array, the Client MAY elect to
	provide its preferred identifier type using the
	<spanx style="verb">subject_type</spanx> parameter during Registration.
      </t>

      <section anchor="PairwiseAlg" title="Pairwise Identifier Algorithm">

	<t>
	  When pairwise Subject Identifiers are used,
	  the OpenID Provider MUST calculate a unique
	  <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) value for each
	  Sector Identifier.  The Subject Identifier value MUST NOT be reversible
	  by any party other than the OpenID Provider.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Providers that use pairwise <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> values
	  and support
	  <xref target="OpenID.Registration">Dynamic Client Registration</xref>
	  SHOULD use the <spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx> parameter.
	  It provides a way for a group of websites under common administrative 
	  control to have consistent pairwise <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> 
	  values independent of the individual domain names.
	  It also provides a way for Clients to change 
	  <spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx> domains without having to 
	  reregister all of their users.
	</t>

	<t>If the Client has not provided a value for
	<spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx> in 
	<xref target="OpenID.Registration">Dynamic Client Registration</xref>,
	the Sector Identifier
	used for pairwise identifier calculation is the host component 
	of the registered <spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx>.
	If there are multiple hostnames in the registered
	<spanx style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx>, the Client MUST register a 
	<spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx>.</t>

	<t>When a <spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx>
	is provided, the host component of that URL is used as
	the Sector Identifier for the pairwise identifier calculation.
	The value of the <spanx style="verb">sector_identifier_uri</spanx>
	MUST be a URL using the <spanx style="verb">https</spanx> scheme that points to
	a JSON file containing an array of
	<spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx> values.
	The values of the registered <spanx style="verb">redirect_uris</spanx>
	MUST be included in the elements of the array.
	</t>

	<t>
	  Any algorithm with the following properties
	  can be used by OpenID Providers to
	  calculate pairwise Subject Identifiers:

	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      The Subject Identifier value MUST NOT be reversible
	      by any party other than the OpenID Provider.
	    </t>

	      Distinct Sector Identifier values MUST result in
	      distinct Subject Identifier values.

	    <t>
	      The algorithm MUST be deterministic.

	      The Sector Identifier can be concatenated with a local account ID and a salt 
	      value that is kept secret by the Provider. The concatenated string is then 
	      hashed using an appropriate algorithm.
	      <vspace blankLines="1"/>
	      Calculate <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> = SHA-256 ( sector_identifier || local_account_id || salt ).

	<t>Some OpenID Connect installations can use a pre-configured set of
	OpenID Providers and/or Relying Parties. In those cases, it might not be
	necessary to support dynamic discovery of information about identities
	or services or dynamic registration of Clients.</t>

	<t>However, if installations choose to support unanticipated
	interactions between Relying Parties and OpenID Providers that do not
	have pre-configured relationships, they SHOULD accomplish this by
	implementing the facilities defined in the <xref
	target="OpenID.Discovery">OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0</xref> and <xref
	target="OpenID.Registration">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</xref>
	specifications.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="RPMTI" title="Mandatory to Implement Features for Relying Parties">
	<t>
	  In general, it is up to Relying Parties which features they use
	  when interacting with OpenID Providers.
	  However, some choices are dictated by the nature of their OAuth Client,
	  such as whether it is a Confidential Client, capable of keeping secrets,
	  in which case the Authorization Code Flow may be appropriate,
	  or whether it is a Public Client, for instance, a
	  User Agent Based Application or a statically registered Native Application,
	  in which case the Implicit Flow may be appropriate.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When using OpenID Connect features, those listed as being
	  "REQUIRED" or are described with a "MUST" are
	  mandatory to implement, when used by a Relying Party.
	  Likewise, those features that are described as "OPTIONAL"
	  need not be used or supported unless they provide value
	  in the particular application context.
	  Finally, when interacting with OpenID Providers that support Discovery,
	  the OP's Discovery document can be used to dynamically determine
	  which OP features are available for use by the RP.

	<section anchor="CodeNotes" title="Authorization Code Implementation Notes">
	  <t>
	    When using the Authorization Code or Hybrid flows,
	    an ID Token is returned from the Token Endpoint
	    in response to a Token Request using an Authorization Code.
	    Some implementations may choose to encode state about
	    the ID Token to be returned in the Authorization Code value.
	    Others may use the Authorization Code value
	    as an index into a database storing this state.
	  </t>
	</section>

	<section anchor="NonceNotes" title="Nonce Implementation Notes">
	  <t>
	    The <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx> parameter value needs to include
	    per-session state and be unguessable to attackers.
	    One method to achieve this for Web Server Clients is to store a cryptographically random value
	    as an HttpOnly session cookie and use a cryptographic hash of the value
	    as the <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx> parameter.
	    In that case, the <spanx style="verb">nonce</spanx> in the returned
	    ID Token is compared to the hash of the session cookie
	    to detect ID Token replay by third parties.
	    A related method applicable to JavaScript Clients is to store the cryptographically random value
	    in HTML5 local storage and use a cryptographic hash of this value.

	<section anchor="FragmentNotes"
		 title="Redirect URI Fragment Handling Implementation Notes">
	  <t>
	    When response parameters are returned in the Redirection URI fragment value,
	    the Client needs to have the User Agent parse the fragment encoded values
	    and pass them to on to the Client's processing logic for consumption.
	    User Agents that have direct access to cryptographic APIs may be able to be
	    self-contained, for instance, with all Client code being written in JavaScript.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    However, if the Client does not run entirely in the User Agent,
	    one way to achieve this
	    is to post them to a Web Server Client for validation.
	  </t>

	  <t>The following is an example of a JavaScript file that a Client might host at its
	  <spanx style="verb">redirect_uri</spanx>.  This is loaded by the redirect from
	  the Authorization Server.  The fragment component is parsed and then sent by <spanx style="verb">POST</spanx> to a URI 
	  that will validate and use the information received.</t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="TokenManufacture"
	       title="Token Manufacture/Modification">
	<t>
	  An Attacker might generate a bogus token or modify the token contents

	  of an existing parseable token, causing the RP to grant 
	  inappropriate access to the Client. For example, an Attacker might modify 
	  the parseable token to extend the validity period; a Client might modify the 
	  parseable token to have access to information that they should not be able to view.

	<t>
	  Access Tokens are credentials used to access Protected

	<t>
	  The server response disclosure can be mitigated in the following two
	  ways:
	  <list style="numbers">
	    <t>Using the <spanx style="verb">code</spanx> Response Type.
	    The response is sent over a TLS protected

      </section>

      <section anchor="AuthCodeCapture"
	       title=" Eavesdropping or Leaking Authorization Codes (Secondary Authenticator Capture)">
	<t>In addition to the attack patterns described in
	Section 4.4.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6819"/>,
	an Authorization Code can be captured in the User Agent where the TLS
	session is terminated if the User Agent is infected by malware.
	However, capturing it is not useful as long as either
	Client Authentication or an encrypted response is used.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="TokenSubstitution" title="Token Substitution">
	<t>
	  Token Substitution is a class of attacks in which a malicious user
	  swaps various tokens, including swapping an Authorization Code for
	  a legitimate user with another token that the attacker has.
	  One means of accomplishing this is for the attacker to copy
	  a token out one session and use it in an HTTP message for
	  a different session, which is easy to do when the token is
	  available to the browser; this is known as the "cut and paste" attack.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The Implicit Flow of <xref target="RFC6749">OAuth 2.0</xref>
	  is not designed to mitigate this risk.  In Section 10.16,
	  it normatively requires that any use of the authorization
	  process as a form of delegated End-User authentication to the
	  Client MUST NOT use the Implicit Flow without employing
	  additional security mechanisms that enable the Client to
	  determine whether the ID Token and Access Token were issued for its use.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In OpenID Connect, this is mitigated through mechanisms
	  provided through the ID Token.  The ID Token is a signed
	  security token that provides Claims such as
	  <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer),
	  <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject),
	  <spanx style="verb">aud</spanx> (audience),
	  <spanx style="verb">azp</spanx> (authorized party),
	  <spanx style="verb">at_hash</spanx> (access token hash), and
	  <spanx style="verb">c_hash</spanx> (code hash).  Using the ID Token,
	  the Client is capable of detecting the Token Substitution Attack.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">c_hash</spanx> in the ID Token enables
	  Clients to prevent Authorization Code substitution.
	  The <spanx style="verb">at_hash</spanx> in the ID Token enables
	  Clients to prevent Access Token substitution.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Also, a malicious user may attempt to impersonate a more
	  privileged user by subverting the communication channel
	  between the Authorization Endpoint and Client, or the Token Endpoint
	  and Client, for example by swapping the Authorization Code
	  or reordering the messages, to convince the Token Endpoint
	  that the attacker's authorization grant corresponds to a grant
	  sent on behalf of a more privileged user.
	</t>
	<t>
	  For the HTTP binding defined by this specification, the
	  responses to Token Requests are bound to the corresponding
	  requests by message order in HTTP, as both the response
	  containing the token and requests are protected by TLS, which
	  will detect and prevent packet reordering.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When designing another binding of this specification to a
	  protocol incapable of strongly binding Token Endpoint
	  requests to responses, additional mechanisms to
	  address this issue MUST be utilized. One such mechanism could
	  be to include an ID Token with a <spanx style="verb">c_hash</spanx>
	  Claim in the token request and response.
	</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="TimingAttack" title="Timing Attack">
	<t>A timing attack enables the attacker to 
	obtain an unnecessary large amount of information through the elapsed time 
	differences in the code paths taken by successful and unsuccessful decryption operations or
	successful and unsuccessful signature validation of a message. 
	It can be used to reduce the effective key length of the

      <section anchor="SigningOrder" title="Signing and Encryption Order">
	<t>
	  Signatures over encrypted text are not considered valid
	  in many jurisdictions.
	  Therefore, for integrity and non-repudiation,
	  this specification requires signing 
	  the plain text JSON Claims, when signing is performed.
	  If both signing and encryption are desired, it is performed on
	  the JWS containing the signed Claims,
	  with the result being a Nested JWT, as specified in <xref target="JWT"/>.
	  Note that since all JWE encryption algorithms provide integrity protection,
	  there is no need to separately sign the encrypted content.

	<t>OpenID Connect supports multiple Issuers per Host and Port combination.
	The issuer returned by discovery MUST exactly match the value of 
	<spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> in the ID Token.</t>

	  OpenID Connect treats the path component of any Issuer URI as
	  being part of the Issuer Identifier.  For instance, the subject

	  Also, <spanx style="verb">client_secret</spanx> values MUST also contain
	  at least the minimum of number of octets required for MAC keys for the
	  particular algorithm used.
	  So for instance, for <spanx style="verb">HS256</spanx>, the
	  <spanx style="verb">client_secret</spanx> value MUST contain
	  at least 32 octets (and almost certainly SHOULD contain more,

      <section anchor="OfflineAccessPrivacy" title="Offline Access">

	<t>
	  Offline access enables access to Claims when the user is not present,
	  posing greater privacy risk than the Claims transfer when the user is present.
	  Therefore, it is prudent to obtain explicit consent for
	  offline access to resources.
	  This specification mandates the use of the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx>
	  parameter to obtain consent unless it is already known that the
	  request complies with the conditions for processing the request in each jurisdiction.
	</t>
	<t>
	  When an Access Token is returned via the User Agent
	  using the Implicit Flow or Hybrid Flow, there is
	  a greater risk of it being exposed to an attacker, who could
	  later use it to access the UserInfo endpoint.
	  If the Access Token does not enable offline access and the server
	  can differentiate whether the Client request has been made
	  offline or online, the risk will be substantially reduced.
	  Therefore, this specification mandates ignoring
	  the offline access request when the Access Token is
	  transmitted through the User Agent.
	  Note that differentiating between online and offline access
	  from the server can be difficult especially for native clients.
	  The server may well have to rely on heuristics.
	  Also, the risk of exposure for the Access Token delivered
	  through the User Agent for the Response Types of
	  <spanx style="verb">code&nbsp;token</spanx> and
	  <spanx style="verb">token</spanx> is the same.
	  Thus, the implementations should be prepared to detect
	  whether the Access Token was issued through the User Agent
	  or directly from the Token Endpoint and deny offline access
	  if the token was issued through the User Agent.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that although these provisions require an explicit
	  consent dialogue through the <spanx style="verb">prompt</spanx> parameter,
	  the mere fact that the user pressed an "accept" button etc.,
	  might not constitute a valid consent.
	  Developers should be aware that for the act of consent to
	  be valid, typically, the impact of the terms have to be
	  understood by the End-User, the consent must be freely given
	  and not forced (i.e., other options have to be available),
	  and the terms must fair and equitable.
	  In general, it is advisable for the service to follow the
	  required privacy principles in each jurisdiction and rely on
	  other conditions for processing the request than simply explicit consent,
	  as online self-service "explicit consent" often does not
	  form a valid consent in some jurisdictions.

	  The value of the <spanx style="verb">id_token</spanx> parameter is the ID Token,
	  which is a signed JWT,
	  containing three base64url encoded segments separated by period ('.') characters.
	  The first segment represents the JOSE Header.
	  Base64url decoding it will result in the following set of Header Parameters:

	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">alg</spanx> value represents the algorithm
	  that was used to sign the JWT, in this case
	  <spanx style="verb">RS256</spanx>, representing RSASSA-PKCS-v1_5 using SHA-256.
	  The <spanx style="verb">kid</spanx> value is a key identifier used
	  in identifying the key to be used to verify the signature.
	  If the <spanx style="verb">kid</spanx> value is unknown to the RP,
	  it needs to retrieve the contents of the OP's JWK Set again
	  to obtain the OP's current set of keys.
